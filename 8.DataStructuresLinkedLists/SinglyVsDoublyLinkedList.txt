Singly Linked List:
1. **Structure:** A singly linked list is made up of nodes, where each node has two components: a value and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list.
2. **Traversal:** You can only traverse the list in one direction, typically from the head (start) to the tail (end).
3. **Memory:** It consumes less memory compared to doubly linked lists because it only stores a reference to the next node.
4. **Use Case:** Singly linked lists are useful when you need to move forward through a list, and memory efficiency is a priority.
Common use cases include implementing stacks and queues.

Doubly Linked List:
1. **Structure:** A doubly linked list also consists of nodes, but each node has two references: one to the next node and another to the previous node.
2. **Traversal:** You can traverse the list in both forward and backward directions, which allows for more flexibility in algorithms.
3. **Memory:** It consumes more memory compared to singly linked lists due to the extra reference for the previous node.
4. **Use Case:** Doubly linked lists are useful when you need to traverse a list in both directions, and you are willing to trade some memory efficiency
for that flexibility. Common use cases include implementing certain types of data structures, such as text editors.

When to Use Each:
- Use a **singly linked list** when you need to perform operations that only require forward traversal and when memory efficiency is crucial. For example,
if you're implementing a basic stack or queue, a singly linked list is a good choice.

- Use a **doubly linked list** when you need to traverse a list in both directions or if you anticipate operations that involve backward traversal.
This extra flexibility can be beneficial in certain algorithms or data structures. For example, doubly linked lists are commonly used in text editors
for efficient cursor movement.




*** A real-world examples of using singly and doubly linked lists: ***

**Singly Linked List Example:**

Imagine you're building a to-do list application. Each task in your to-do list can be represented as a node in a singly linked list.
Each node contains the task description and a reference to the next task in the list. You can efficiently add new tasks to the end of the list (appending)
and remove completed tasks (deleting nodes) from the list. Traversing the list to display tasks from start to finish is straightforward.

**Doubly Linked List Example:**

Now, let's consider a web browser's navigation history. Each webpage visited can be represented as a node in a doubly linked list.
Each node contains the URL of the webpage, a reference to the previous webpage visited, and a reference to the next webpage visited.

- When you click the "back" button in the browser, it's a backward traversal to the previous webpage in the list (using the backward reference).
- When you click the "forward" button, it's a forward traversal to the next webpage in the list (using the forward reference).

The doubly linked list allows you to efficiently navigate both backward and forward through your browsing history.

In both examples, the choice between singly and doubly linked lists depends on the direction of traversal and the efficiency of common operations.
For a to-do list, you might only need to traverse forward, making a singly linked list sufficient. In contrast, web browser history needs
both forward and backward traversal, making a doubly linked list a better fit.
