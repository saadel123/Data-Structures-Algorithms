Both AVL Trees and Red-Black Trees are types of self-balancing binary search trees. They are used in data structures and databases to maintain efficient operations
such as searching, insertion, and deletion. Here's a simple explanation of their uses:

**1. AVL Trees:**
   - AVL Trees are designed to maintain strict balance, ensuring that the height difference between the left and right subtrees (known as the balance factor)
   of any node is no more than 1.
   - They are ideal for scenarios where read operations are more frequent than write operations.
   - Best suited for situations where you need consistent and fast searching with a guarantee of logarithmic (O(log n)) time complexity for various operations.

**2. Red-Black Trees:**
   - Red-Black Trees are also self-balancing trees, but they allow for a little more leeway in terms of balance compared to AVL Trees.
   - They are more balanced than simple binary search trees but are generally easier to maintain than AVL Trees.
   - Red-Black Trees are commonly used in scenarios where there's a mix of read and write operations, as they offer a good balance between efficient
   searching and updating.
   - They guarantee logarithmic (O(log n)) time complexity for various operations.

In summary, AVL Trees offer stricter balance, which is beneficial for read-heavy workloads, while Red-Black Trees provide a more balanced compromise between read
and write operations. The choice between them depends on your specific use case and the trade-offs you are willing to make in terms of balance and complexity.
