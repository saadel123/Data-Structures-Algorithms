And cues are used again a lot in programming problems and interview questions.
For example, if you had any sort of waitlist app to perhaps buy tickets for a concert that uses cues,
what about a restaurant app where you check into the restaurant to see if you can get a table that uses cues?
What about Uber or Lyft when you want to grab a ride?
Well, the person that requested the ride first will get priority and then you'll get second.
And then finally, the most common example of cues is a printer, right?
If you had a printer at home and you had three people on three different computers at your home, let's
say your family members and you press print and each person prints different items.
The person that clicks print first should have their first printout and same for the second person that goes next. And then the third person.
Now on the right here, I have a couple of words that are different than push and pop.
