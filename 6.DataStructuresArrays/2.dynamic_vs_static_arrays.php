In PHP, arrays are inherently dynamic, meaning they can grow and shrink as needed. However, the concept of dynamic vs.
static arrays is often used to explain arrays with fixed size (static) versus arrays that can change in size (dynamic).
Here's a simple explanation:

### Static Array
A static array has a fixed size, and you cannot add or remove elements once it's created. PHP does not natively support
true static arrays, but you can simulate one by setting a predefined size and not modifying it afterward.

Example of a Static Array:
```php
<?php
$staticArray = [1, 2, 3, 4]; // Fixed-size array
echo count($staticArray); // Outputs: 4

// Trying to add an element
$staticArray[] = 5; // Allowed in PHP, but violates the "static" concept
?>
```

### Dynamic Array
A dynamic array can grow or shrink as needed. PHP arrays are inherently dynamic, which means you can add or remove
elements without worrying about the size.

Example of a Dynamic Array:
```php
<?php
$dynamicArray = []; // Start with an empty array

// Adding elements
$dynamicArray[] = 10; // Add a value to the end
$dynamicArray[] = 20;

// Adding with a key
$dynamicArray['key'] = 'value';

// Removing an element
unset($dynamicArray[0]); // Removes the first element (10)

// Display the array
print_r($dynamicArray);
// Output:
// Array (
//    [1] => 20
//    [key] => value
// )
?>
```

### Key Differences
| Feature | Static Array | Dynamic Array |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Size | Fixed, determined at creation. | Can grow or shrink dynamically. |
| Flexibility | Limited, not modifiable. | Fully flexible, can add/remove elements. |
| Implementation | Rare in PHP, requires constraints. | Default behavior of PHP arrays. |

In practice, PHP arrays are always dynamic unless you impose manual restrictions to treat them as static.
