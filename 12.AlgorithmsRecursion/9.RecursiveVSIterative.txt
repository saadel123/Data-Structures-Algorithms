! Anything you do with a recursion CAN be done iteratively (loop)

**Recursive Function:**
- **Definition:** A function that calls itself during its execution.
- **Example:** The classic example is calculating the factorial of a number or computing Fibonacci numbers.
- **How it works:** The function breaks down the problem into smaller sub-problems and calls itself to solve each sub-problem.
- **Advantages:**
  - **Readability:** Recursive solutions can be more intuitive, especially for problems with a recursive nature.
  - **Elegant Code:** Recursive code can be concise and elegant for certain problems.

**Iterative Function:**
- **Definition:** A function that uses a loop to repeat a specific block of code.
- **Example:** Calculating the factorial using a `for` loop or iterating over an array.
- **How it works:** The function uses a loop structure (like `for` or `while`) to repeat a set of instructions until a certain condition is met.
- **Advantages:**
  - **Efficiency:** Iterative solutions often use less memory and can be more efficient for certain problems.
  - **No Stack Overflow Risk:** Iterative solutions are generally safer for large inputs as they don't risk causing a stack overflow.

**When to Use Recursive vs. Iterative:**
- **Recursive:**
  - **Nature of the Problem:** When the problem has a recursive structure, like tree traversal or certain mathematical calculations (e.g., Fibonacci).
  - **Readability:** When a recursive solution leads to clearer and more readable code.
  - **Less Code:** For some problems, recursive solutions can be more concise.

- **Iterative:**
  - **Efficiency:** When efficiency and memory usage are critical, as iterative solutions often use less memory.
  - **No Stack Overflow Risk:** For problems with large inputs where a stack overflow risk exists in a recursive solution.

**Choosing Between Them:**
- **Balance:** It's often about striking a balance between readability and efficiency.
- **Nature of the Problem:** Some problems naturally lend themselves to recursive solutions, while others are more naturally solved iteratively.
- **Stack Overflow Risk:** For problems with large inputs, especially where the risk of a stack overflow exists, an iterative solution might be safer.

In conclusion, both recursive and iterative solutions have their places. The choice depends on the nature of the problem, efficiency considerations,
and the desire for clear and concise code.
